window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the stillness of space, several asteroids disappear in the 82 G. Eridani System. Time passes and space wavers, and the missing asteroids reappear. They’re traveling at near-light-speed for the single populated planet. Nuclear-tipped missiles from the lone battleship fail to stop the asteroids, which crash against the planet, turning it into rubble and killing the 650 million inhabitants.</p> <p>Someone has found and now tested the perfect planet killer, an ancient device that turns asteroids and icy planetesimals into world-destroying projectiles. Earth is a mere 20 light-years away. But who’s to say the hidden weapon will head there next? It can go anywhere in the commonwealth and destroy any world.</p> <p>Star Watch is desperate, employing every ship, every scientist, and everyone, including the crew of <i>Victory</i>, to defend the planets.</p> <p>Captain Maddox, Professor Ludendorff, and others must put aside every difference and concentrate on finding a weakness in the ultimate weapon, one they can exploit. Otherwise - the alternative is too stark to contemplate. It is time to pull together and think and fight like never before.</p> <p><b><i>The Lost Tech</i></b><b> is the 13th book in the Lost Starship series.</b></p>";
