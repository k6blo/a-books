window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Captain Nemo</i> is the fictional life story of one of Jules Verne's most memorable characters from <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> and <i>The Mysterious Island</i>. It covers his boyhood friendship with the dreamer Jules Verne, adventures aboard sailing ships, battles with pirates, and survival on a mysterious deserted island. Each time he returns home to his beloved France, Captain Nemo shares the tales of his exploits with the struggling writer Verne. We follow Nemo's exploration of hidden caverns that lead to the center of the earth, his travels across darkest Africa in a hydrogen balloon, and his imprisonment by an evil Ottoman caliph who commands the dark genius to construct a submarine boat, the <i>Nautilus</i>, in order to attack merchant ships that venture through the newly completed Suez Canal.</p>";
