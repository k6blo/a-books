She has been personally selected for a mission that will, should she succeed, save millions of lives. </p><p>The Peterwald Empire is in the midst of civil war. On one side is the tyrannical empress; on the other is the last person Kris ever wants to see again: Grand Duchess Vicky Peterwald. Due to their shared history, the emperor believes Kris can mediate between the factions and bring about peace. But before Kris even begins her mission, she survives multiple assassination attempts on her family's home world. Someone doesn't want her interfering in the empire's affairs. Kris immediately suspects Vicky or the empress, only to learn that it could also be a traitor among her own people. </p>";
