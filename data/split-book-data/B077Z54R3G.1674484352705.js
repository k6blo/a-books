window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A visionary science fiction classic from Larry Niven and Steven Barnes.</b> </p> <p><i>The Barsoom Project</i> is the direct sequel to 1981's <i>Dream Park</i>. Eviane's first visit to the state-of-art amusement arena Dream Park ended in disaster: the special effects had seemed more real than life ...until the holograms she was shooting with live ammunition turned out to be solid flesh and blood ...and very, very dead. </p> <p>Haunted by the past, rebounding from a lengthy spell in a mental hospital, she has returned to Dream Park to exorcise a nightmare that has become reality. But in Dream Park, nothing is what it seems. The Inuit mythology controlling the images is part of a \"Fat Ripper Special\" designed to implant new behavioral memes. The players are struggling against the game master, one another, and their own demons. And there is a killer who wants to ensure Eviane never regains her memory...no matter what it costs. </p> <p>Blending together hard science fiction with virtual reality and RPG-like fantasy games, <i>The Barsoom Project</i> is science fiction at the cutting edge and a classic creation from two of the genre's most beloved writers. </p>";
