window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From USA Today best-selling author Raymond L. Weil comes the second book in the Star Cross series. </p> <p>Over 14 months have passed since Fleet Admiral Kurt Vickers drove the Profiteers from Earth. Eighty million people died while the planet was being ransacked and its wealth stolen. Now a new and deadlier threat comes from intergalactic space. An enemy so alien and so ruthless the entire galaxy is at risk. </p> <p>The Destroyers of Worlds look upon all intelligent life as a source of food. Their ships are nearly indestructible, and they have come to the galaxy to begin their harvest. Even the Protector Worlds are powerless to stop the growing list of planets that are falling victim to the hungry Vorn. </p> <p>At Newton, Admiral Kurt Vickers learns of this new enemy as well as a growing threat from the Profiteers. High Profiteer Creed is gathering a powerful fleet in the Gothan Empire. He plans to take everything of value from Earth and then turn the planet into a nuclear wasteland. Admiral Vickers is once more forced to return to Kubitz. A black market world considered to be the worst hellhole in the galaxy. Only on Kubitz can Admiral Vickers find what he needs to save Earth. </p>";
