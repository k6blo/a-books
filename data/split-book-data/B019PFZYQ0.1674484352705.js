Earth has been invaded, and the defensive fleets in orbit have been annihilated. </p> <p>For decades, humans have been exploring farther and farther away from Earth and Newton searching for signs of intelligent life. Now that intelligent life has found them, it comes as an invader. </p> <p>The enemy is ruthless, powerful, and has a disdain for human life.
