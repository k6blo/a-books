window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first novel in a new space adventure series! </p> <p>Aramis Reyne is an old space captain, hounded by arthritis and haunted by memories of war. He makes ends meet by running mail and supplies to the farthest, darkest reaches of the system known as the fringe. When Reyne and his ragtag crew salvage a dead ship during one of their runs, they find themselves thrown into a galactic conspiracy involving warship captains, secret organizations, fringe rebels, and pirates. With interplanetary war on the horizon, Reyne must confront wartime ghosts and dust off old skills or else he'll be forced to watch thousands of innocents be slaughtered, again. </p> <p>Where the series takes place: After the colonization of Mars and Europa, it took us fewer than five generations to reach beyond our solar system and discover new planets capable of supporting human life. Too far away to be governed under Earth law, the Collective was formed. Several hundred years later, the Collective has expanded to a thriving system of six inhabited worlds. Power struggles and interplanetary rivalries are common, and tensions are growing between the elite and working classes. </p>";
