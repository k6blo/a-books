window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ben Bova’s extraordinary Moonbase Saga continues with a breathtaking near-future adventure rich in character and incident. </p> <p>Seven years after the indomitable Doug Stavenger has realized his cherished dream of establishing a colony on the inhospitable lunar surface, Moonbase is a thriving community, a marvel of scientific achievement created and supported by nanotechnology: virus-sized machines that can build, cure, and destroy. But nanotechnology has been declared illegal by the home planet’s leaders, and a powerful despot is determined to lay claim to Stavenger’s peaceful city - or obliterate it, if necessary. The people of Moonbase, a colony with no arms or military, must now defend themselves from earthborn aggression with the only weapon at their disposal: the astonishing technology that sustains their endangered home. </p> <p>About the author: Ben Bova, six-time winner of the Hugo Award, is the author of over one hundred futuristic novels and nonfiction books. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation in 2005, and his novel <i>Titan</i> won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for the best science fiction novel of 2006.</p>";
