window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Caitlin Diggs will have more to worry about than her on-again, off-again romance with her FBI superior when the goddess Isis appears in her mind. Is this a trick or perhaps an evil entity linked to her psychic gift offered by the crystal? The crystal has offered Caitlin psychic gifts but also a strange connection to the Star of the Sea, or Isis. Even her cat Bastet seems to share in this linkage.</p> <p>To make matters more complex, Diggs finds the Ennead has returned to Earth as promised. But are they here to share secrets of the pyramids or to take over? Murders and a mass demon disappearance coincide with their arrival to invite not only high strangeness but high suspicion.</p> <p>Now Diggs must question if she is under the influence of gods, aliens, or a criminal concoction of both. Because she can't fingerprint the \"gods\", Diggsâ€™ search for the truth will take her to an unparalleled journey she could never imagine.&nbsp;</p> <p>Time traveling to ancient Egypt may very well reveal the truth of our origins and Caitlin's true destiny with the crystal entity - but at what ultimate price?</p>";
