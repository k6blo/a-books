But the attractive young woman with the scarred face knows him all too well. An FBI agent working undercover, Alex Morse has come to Dr. Shepard’s office in Natchez, Mississippi, to unmask a killer. A local divorce attorney has a cluster of clients whose spouses have all died under mysterious circumstances. Agent Morse’s own brother-in-law was one of those clients, and now her beloved sister is dead. Then comes Morse's bombshell: Dr. Shepard’s own beautiful wife consulted this lawyer one week ago, a visit Shepard knew nothing about. Will he help Alex Morse catch a killer? Or is he the next one to fall victim to a deadly trap of sex, lies, and murder?</p> <p>Brimming with the masterful suspense and intense psychological drama that made <i>Turning Angel</i>,<i> Blood Memory</i>, and <i>The Quiet Game</i> bestsellers, <i>True Evil</i> is an unnerving tale of evil lurking beneath the veneer of idyllic suburban life.</p>";
