With his odd talents, the pickings were easy enough so that Flinx did not have to be dishonest ... most of the time.</p><p>In fact, it hardly seemed dishonest at all to steal a starmap from a dead body that didn't really need it anymore. But Flinx wasn't quite smart enough. He should have wondered why the body was dead in the first place...</p><p> <b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes an exclusive introduction written and read by author Alan Dean Foster.</b></p>";
