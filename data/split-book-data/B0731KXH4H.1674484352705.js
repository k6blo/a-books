window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The crew of the Hotspur just happens to be looking for a new home. If Nick James is right, and he usually is, the Tipperary solar system is about to become the busiest trading hub in the galaxy. To sweeten the pot, the cloud-city of Lèger Nuage is offering free warehouse space to qualified traders. It's a deal that seems too good to pass up. </p> <p>Of course, nothing's as simple as it seems. Just like Earth's Old West, the Tipperary system is as full of promise as it is Buccaneers who are happy to prey on the weak. No one expects it to be easy, but deceit, piracy, and murder kindle the pioneering spirit in each of them. Only the strong will prosper and the question is - can Liam, Nick, and the rest of the crew carve out a place to call their own? </p> <p>Be sure to also check out <i>Rookie Privateer</i>, which is the first in this exciting science fiction series. </p>";
