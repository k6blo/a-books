window.bookSummaryJSON = "This is the first novel Patrick O'Brian ever wrote about the sea, a precursor to the Aubrey/Maturin series that <i>The New York Times</i> has hailed as \"the best historical novels ever written.\" <i>The Golden Ocean</i> shares the high-seas adventure and rich humor of this triumphant series, invoking the eloquent style and authentic historic atmosphere that O'Brian fans love so much. In 1740, two young Irishmen, lifelong friends Peter and Sean, join Commodore Anson and his crew on their quest for fortune and fame on the golden ocean.";
