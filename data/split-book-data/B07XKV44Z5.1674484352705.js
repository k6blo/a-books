window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>During the worst blizzard in decades, a local gentry, the enigmatic Lord Mabbott, falls from his study window and it is at once assumed to be suicide. Lateral thinking private detective John Handful is not so convinced and is determined to prove otherwise and make it his business to know what other people don’t know. Never mind that Lord Mabbott was being blackmailed over an affair with a transgender stepsister-in-law or that the window he jumped from on the fourth floor was locked from the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Before long, another body turns up, believed to be Lord Mabbott’s former lover. The hunt is on to solve the case, and although, John Handful faces fresh adversaries with a stream of alibis and a host of conflicting motives, he is determined to solve the riddle - despite the best efforts of the challenging Mabbott family.</p>";
