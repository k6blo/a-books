A terrifying threat could postpone his victory lap...forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>After discovering an indefensible weapon, Liam thought he had the Kroerak invaders on the ropes. But as he and his crew root out the last alien strongholds, he comes face to face with the staggering damage the invaders wreaked on the crew’s now-inhospitable homeworlds. When the battle-scarred survivors call on Liam to lead their broken civilization out of the rubble, he can’t bear to turn them away.
