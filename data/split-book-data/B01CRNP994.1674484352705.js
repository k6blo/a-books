window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The highly-anticipated finale to the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling 5th Wave series.</p> <p>The enemy is Other. The enemy is us. They’re down here, they’re up there, they’re nowhere. They want the Earth, they want us to have it. They came to wipe us out, they came to save us. But beneath these riddles lies one truth: Cassie has been betrayed. So has Ringer. Zombie. Nugget. And all 7.5 billion people who used to live on our planet. Betrayed first by the Others, and now by ourselves.</p> <p>In these last days, Earth’s remaining survivors will need to decide what’s more important: saving themselves...or saving what makes us human.</p> <p>Praise for <i>The Last Star</i></p> <p>“Yancey’s prose remains achingly precise, and this grows heavier, tighter, and more impossible to put down as the clock runs out.... This blistering finale proves the truth of the first two volumes: it was never about the aliens.” (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“A haunting, unforgettable finale.” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Yancey doesn’t hit the breaks for one moment, and the action is intense, but the language always stays lyrical and lovely. It’s a satisfying end to an impressive trilogy, true to the characters and the world Yancey created.” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Yancey has capped off his riveting series with a perfect ending.” (TeenReads) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“[T]he ending provides both satisfaction and heartbreak.” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Yancey's writing is just as solid and descriptive as in the first two books….What Yancey does beautifully is reveal the human condition.” (Examiner.com)</p> <p>\"Rick Yancey sticks the (alien) landing in the action-packed&nbsp;finale to his&nbsp;The 5th Wave&nbsp;invasion saga....&nbsp;And the author gives us a major dose of girl power as well, pairing Cassie and Ringer for an uneasy alliance that provides&nbsp;the best moments in this fantastic series’ thought-provoking and satisfying conclusion.” (<i>USA Today</i>)</p> <p>Books in the series:&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The 5th Wave</i>&nbsp;(The first book of The 5th Wave)&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Infinite Sea</i>&nbsp;(The second book of The 5th Wave)&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Last Star</i>&nbsp;(The third book of the The 5th Wave)&nbsp;</p>";
