window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's dangerous to get too close to one of those damn Longknife. So Senior Chief Agent in Charge Foile volunteers to get too damn close to the whole family of Longknifes. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Kris Longknife feared the survival of the entire human race might hang on what her Grampa Al did next – but she couldn’t figure out what he was up to. After a career in the Wardhaven Bureau of Investigations, Foile was good at finding out what others wanted to keep hidden. Exactly why he found himself volunteering, he'd never know, but soon he was spending his annual leave digging into what the powerful Longknife family wanted hidden and up to his neck in trouble of every kind. Note about cover photo. This is a file photo of Kris and Nelly when she was in college on the political stump for her father's campaign. For the latest photo of Kris, check out Kris Longknife - Defender. </p>";
