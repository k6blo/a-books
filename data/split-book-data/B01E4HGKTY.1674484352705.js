Her commanding officer is eccentric, rarely seen on the bridge; her former XO has deserted his post; and her first middy is resentful because he hasn't been promoted as he deserves.... </p> <p>But when a first contact mission goes badly wrong, HMS <i>Vanguard</i> and her crew are plunged into an interstellar war against a new and deadly alien threat. And if they don't make it back to friendly space in time, they will merely be the first to die in a new interstellar war. </p>";
