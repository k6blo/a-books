window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Earth’s first colony ship finally reaches the target world. The excitement of planetfall is indescribable, but quickly transforms into sick disappointment when they find the atmosphere is a roiling mass of hydrochloric acid, carbon dioxide, and other deadly poisons.&nbsp;</p> <p>They fly onward, seeking better planets. They find them, but none are ideal. The search goes on for a century, then longer still. As they move farther from Earth, aliens discover the intruding ship, and they begin to investigate humanity. They find our species unacceptable.&nbsp;</p> <p>The years and the light-years go by without relief. The colony begins to splinter. Some accept that their voyage is eternal, while others seek to end it any way they can. The colony’s culture grows darker, and a war begins, both inside and outside the vast ship.&nbsp;</p> <p>What lives among the stars we see at night? Can we reach out to them and survive? Find out in <i>Black Phoenix</i>, a story of exploration, colonization, alien contact, and civil war by Wayne Wightman and B. V. Larson, best-selling SF authors with over three million copies sold.</p>";
