window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The bundled edition of the first three books in the popular Ambassador series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>1: <i>Seeing Red</i> - Cory Wilson is about to start his new job as representative to gamra, the alien organization that controls the network for wormhole travel, when a political murder may well end his career before it starts. In Coldi society, you can get killed for looking a superior in the eye. Never mind accusing him of murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>1A: <i>The Sahara Conspiracy</i> - Cory is asked to deal with the alien mafia on Earth, and stumbles across a plot that endangers Earth's fragile peace. You did not hear me say \"nuke from orbit\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>2: <i>Raising Hell</i> - The wormhole network goes down, and Cory's friend and leader of the largest populated world Asto is caught off-world. Dangerous politics are afoot on Asto, and Cory decides to help his friend. Yeah. Famous last words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This series will appeal to readers who like alien societies that are familiar and disturbingly different at the same time, dangerous political intrigue, edge-of-seat action and characters who are never entirely good or entirely bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop. There are eight books in the series, with more on the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Why not try this one now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
