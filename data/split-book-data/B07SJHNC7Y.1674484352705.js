The first is called the Orion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Many are eager to go, but only 100,000 are chosen for each vessel. Far from Earth, a new life awaits, and it promises the prosperity they've always wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But still, resistance stirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>There are those who are eager to sabotage this new expansion effort, threatening the promise of a new life. As Orion moves through the void of space, towards a distant world, its passengers must fight for survival in an unprecedented conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Win or lose, their future will be forever changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Experience a sprawling galactic tale in this first entry to The Orion Colony series. If you're a fan of <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, or <i>Indiana Jones</i>, you'll love this epic, space opera adventure.</p>";
