window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>While recovering from the physical and emotional wounds he sustained in <i>Challenger's Hope</i>, Nick Seafort is named as the liaison between the wealthy planters of Hope Nation and the United Nations Navy. The lurking, acid-spewing, fish-shaped aliens are a real threat, and everyone is on edge. When the fleet returns to Earth, dissent grows among the people of Hope Nation, who feel abandoned by the military and left at the mercy of the alien horde. The Seafort Saga continues as Nick Seafort takes on powerful rebels at home, the cold-blooded aliens, and his own self-doubt. He must make a choice that could save Hope Nation but would also sentence him to death. </p>";
