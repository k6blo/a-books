Larson comes book two in the epic military space opera adventure saga! </p> <p>Commodore Straker's rebellion grows in strength - but his enemies are growing even faster. Faced with a dozen rebel planets in their territory, the Mutuality finally takes notice of the upstart known as the Liberator, and they gather a vast fleet to crush him. </p> <p>Preparing for a titanic interstellar battle, it's clear Straker has no chance. His tiny enclave of free planets can't survive the weight of a thousand worlds.

The monstrous vessel is well-defended and contains secrets no one suspects. Unleashing its power might turn the tide of the war - but it may also doom humanity. </p> <p><i>Battleship Indomitable</i> is the second book in the Galactic Liberation series. The series starts with book one, <i>Starship Liberator</i>. </p>";
