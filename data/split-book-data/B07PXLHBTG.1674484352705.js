window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When humanity reaches for the stars, our probes are destroyed. They crash into an incredibly advanced piece of technology: a massive force-field. Unknown beings have placed a barrier around our star and planets, enclosing us within. Weâ€™re locked inside a Great Sphere.&nbsp;</p> <p>Was this invisible obstacle built to imprison us - or to protect us? No one knows the truth, but it soon becomes clear the barrier has leaks. Aliens infiltrate and try to sabotage our efforts to escape our cage.&nbsp;</p> <p>A warship crewed by military people and scientists beta-test an engine designed to pass through the barrier. Chief Gray, a security officer from Control, is assigned to help. His mission is critical: Earth must escape her bonds at all costs, even if it means war with our hostile neighbors.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>War of the Spheres</i> is a new novel by James Millington and B. V. Larson, a best-selling SF author with over three million copies sold.</p>";
