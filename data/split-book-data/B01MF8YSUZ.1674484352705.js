window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hang on for dear life - what a ride! </p> <p>At first, young Ryan Chase thought it was no big deal. A minor space collision with a creepy-looking, refurbished Paotow Tanker. Hey, these things happen-right? Sure, unless the one you have plowed into is a murderous psychopath, who has been lying in wait for the young Consignment Freight delivery pilot. The relentless cat-and-mouse galactic chase is on, and Ryan must either match his pursuer's cunning or die trying. </p> <p>Unbeknownst to Ryan, there's much more going on than he realizes. By the time his aunt, ex-president Nan Reynolds, and Captain Jason Reynolds, plus the rest of the Star Watch team, are alerted, a much larger conspiracy is also occurring, and Ryan could already be captured - or worse - dead. </p>";
