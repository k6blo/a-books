window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 2101, having conquered the Solar System, most humans are choosing to tie their minds to an Artificial Intelligence. The only place to be free of AI is living off-world, with Saturn and its vast system of moons serving as the wild frontier. The only caveats to living there: the funds to fly a billion miles into space and a pledge to keep vigil against the threat of AI. Otherwise, what you do out there is your business. </p> <p>Career scoundrel/petty-thief Caleb Day finds himself broke and unemployed when he arrives at his new home among the colonists of Saturn's moons, so he takes a job as a cop. When law enforcement takes a turn for the less-than-just, Caleb refuses to sit idly back. After rescuing and escaping with several civilians, Caleb and his new comrades are now fugitives who must beg, borrow, and steal their way across Saturn's moon colonies to survive. Tensions rise as Earthlings begin looking at Off-Worlders as threats. Keeping his friends safe among Saturn's moons is no longer Caleb's only challenge - he must find a way to protect the last vestige of remaining free humans if they all want any hope at staying alive. </p> <p>A swashbuckling space opera, <i>Bastion Saturn </i>is a dramatic, often humorous, action-packed romp that explores the best and worst of humankind while questioning the very definition of humanity. </p>";
