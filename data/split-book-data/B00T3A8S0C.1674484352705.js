It has succeeded in buying the Human Federation of Worlds valuable time to prepare for the coming invasion. Now Fleet Admiral Streth needs to get his remaining warships back home to aid in the defense of the human worlds. The AIs and the Hocklyns are determined to follow the admiral and annihilate every single human in the federation. The humans are massively outnumbered, but they have a daring plan that just might save their worlds. However, the AIs have a plan of their own--one that will ensure the end of the human race if it succeeds.</p>";
