window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sniper and antihero Skull Denham refuses the Eden Plague rather than giving up the demons that drive him. Instead, he selects his own mission to fight against the ever-growing evil of those who would murder innocent Plague carriers, using the only methods he's ever found effective: swift, precise and brutal violence. </p> <p>Edgier than other Plague Wars novels, <i>Skull's Shadows</i> is a post-apocalyptic thriller meant for mature readers due to language, violence and adult situations. It provides another view of the period following Infection Day and fills in more of Skull's story before he becomes a key player in the future salvation of humanity. </p>";
