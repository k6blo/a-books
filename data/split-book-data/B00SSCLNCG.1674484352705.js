window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Peace is not freedom. Peace is merely the absence of war. </p> <p>The First Interstellar War is over, but the Royal Navy still has plenty of work to do. As Earth struggles to recover from the bombardment, Captain John Naiser is placed in command of HMS <i>Warspite</i> - an experimental heavy cruiser - and ordered to escort a squadron of colony ships to a star system of immense strategic importance. But as the crew struggle to survive hundreds of light years from Earth, they find themselves dealing with the legacy of the war...and a threat that may sow the seeds of renewed conflict or a deadly civil war that will rip the human sphere apart. </p> <p>Like my self-published Kindle books, <i>Warspite</i> is DRM-free. You may reformat it as you choose. There is a large sample of the text - and my other books - on my site: chrishanger.net. Try before you buy.</p>";
