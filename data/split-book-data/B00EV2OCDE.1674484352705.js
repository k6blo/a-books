window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The War is over. The treaty is signed. And all is well in the galaxy.... </b></p><p>Izzy Umboto is a hero of the conflict between the Society of Humanity and the Unity Party. Instead of retiring and living out her days quietly, she's wrangled command of her very own warship. Unfortunately, that ship is the less-than-state-of-the-art Patton. </p><p>Lieutenant Terrence Tordon, called \"Trouble\" by both his enemies and his friends, and even himself, is a career marine. The word \"quit\" isn't in his vocabulary. </p><p>Now Lieutenant Trouble and his troops have signed on with Commander Umboto, trading a higher paycheck for the promise of action. </p><p>For all is not well in the galaxy. On the scattering of planets along the rim, remnant thugs of the Unity Party still hold power. In the shipping lanes of rim space, pirates roam freely. </p><p>Umboto and Tordon will soon learn that enforcing the peace can be just as expensive as fighting the war - and the cost will be counted in human lives....</p>";
