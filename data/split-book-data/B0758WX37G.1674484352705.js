window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Following closely on the heels of Buccaneers, Liam and the crew of Hotspur take a much needed vacation on the tropical planet Curie, where they have nothing more to do than enjoy sun and sand. Trouble is never far away for this group of privateers, however, as a mysterious invitation to meet the reclusive Phillipe Anino interrupts their holiday. With more wealth than could be spent in 20 lifetimes, and access to illicit technology and information, Anino discovered a common interest with the crew - the fate of the Cape of Good Hope. Anino believes he has a way to recover the Cape's crew, but to do so will pit Liam and his friends against the powerful Belirand Corporation. Will the crew of Hotspur take the risky mission and become fugitives for the sake of 45 people they don't know? Or will they leave the people on board the Cape of Good Hope to die, alone in the deep dark of space? There's more at stake than any of them could guess. The actions of Liam and his friends could very well change the known universe forever. </p>";
