window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before he was anointed to carry on the legacy of Robert Ludlum's Janson Command series, and before he collaborated with Clive Cussler on the fan favorite Isaac Bell series, Justin Scott created this suspenseful adventure tale, a novel of love and revenge set on the high seas. Written in 1978, this is considered by many to be one of the best maritime thrillers of all time. As an expert in the world of ships and sailing, Justin Scott creates an authentic maritime world, making <i>The Shipkiller</i> all the more thrilling because it could be a true story. Audible favorite Marc Vietor brings this suspenseful adventure tale to vivid life with his exciting and well-paced narration.</p>";
