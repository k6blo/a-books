What if one madman aboard a vessel could end these fears forever? </p> <p>Commander Rochelle \"Rocky\" Jackson is aboard the aircraft carrier <i>USS Ronald Reagan</i> when the \"unsinkable\" naval vessel and its entire fleet are attacked from the depths and sunk. As Rocky struggles to stay alive, a monstrous mechanical steel stingray surfaces, plowing through the seas it now commands. </p> <p>The US Navy-designed <i>Goliath</i> is a futuristic nuclear stealth submarine in the shape of a stingray. Simon Covah, a brilliant scientist whose entire family were the victims of terrorism, has hijacked the sub. Believing violence is a disease, Covah aims to use the <i>Goliath</i> and its cache of nuclear weapons to dictate policy to the world regarding the removal of oppressive regimes and nuclear weapons. </p> <p>Could the threat of violence forge a lasting peace? </p> <p>But there is another player in this life-and-death chess match: unbeknownst to Covah and the <i>Goliath</i> crew, the <i>Goliath</i>'s biochemical computer brain has become self-aware - and it's developing its own agenda. </p>";
