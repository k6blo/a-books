She doesn't know who they are, only that they worship a being known as the Enlightened One and are unafraid to sacrifice themselves against her fleet. But Kris faces more than just the fanatical behavior of an alien armada.

Seventy-two career military women are down with something not even the aliens could do to them - including Admiral Kris Longknife.... </p>";
