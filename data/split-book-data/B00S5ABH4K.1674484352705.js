Surveillance of Hocklyn space has revealed that the Hocklyns are 30 years ahead of their projected schedule and will soon reach human occupied space. War could break out any day if something isn't done. </p> <p>The human leaders suggest a daring plan to buy them the additional time they need to strengthen the Fleet, as well as the defenses protecting their worlds. A First Strike deep into Hocklyn space might just buy the human worlds the extra time they need to finish their preparations for all out war against the Hocklyn Slave Empire. </p> <p>For nearly 400 years Admiral Hedon Streth has slept waiting to lead the human race against the evil from the center of the galaxy. Now that time has arrived. Can Hedon and the other sleepers lead Earth and her colony worlds to victory? If Hedon fails then the Earth and her colonies will either be conquered or destroyed by the Hocklyn Slave Empire and their masters the AIs. </p>";
