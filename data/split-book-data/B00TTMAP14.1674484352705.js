window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The universal order is unraveling. The enslaved cry out for freedom. The apocalypse is now. Devis Cameron, hero of the Xenophobe War and the Empire's reluctant champion, has been posted to the 4th Terran Rangers - a gaijin Warstrider unit on New America - to eliminate a newly discovered underground colony of Xenos and to deal harshly with civil unrest spawned by Imperial repression. The situation is rapidly degenerating into total anarchy. And the nuclear option may be the only alternative. </p> <p>But Dev is uncomfortable with the role that has been assigned to him. And now he must choose between betraying his masters or his principles - to crush a righteous revolution or to help forge an alliance between the Empire's enemies and an inscrutable race of alien monsters.</p>";
